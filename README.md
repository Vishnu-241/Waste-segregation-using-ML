# Waste-segregation-using-ML
 
A mechanical and software setup can be used for separating the
wet waste, dry waste, and e-waste into separate containers here sensors can be used for
separating wet and dry. For detecting the presence of any waste wet or dry can be detected using
an IR sensor in the next step for detecting wet waste a moister sensor can be used and e- waste
can be sensed from two machine learning models, a multilayer perceptron and multilayer
convolutional neural network (ML-CNN). The multilayer perceptron is used to provide binary
classification, i.e., dry or wet and electronic waste, and the CNN identifies the classes of various
wastes.
